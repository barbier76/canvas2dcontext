Code for a presentation I'm giving my class on HTML5 Canvas in two dimensional contexts.

The examples from this presentation were based on the excellent resources of Core HTML5 Canvas: Graphics, Animation and Game Development by David Geary <http://corehtml5canvas.com/> and HTML5 Canvas Tutorials by Eric Rowell <http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/>.
